# Keylogger Project

This project demonstrates how keyloggers work, their potential risks, and the importance of securing devices against them. The keylogger is written in Python and is for **educational purposes only**. By understanding the mechanics of a keylogger, users can better protect themselves from malicious actors who use such tools to steal sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.

**Disclaimer:**  
- This project is intended for learning purposes only.  
- Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.  
- Only run this script in controlled environments with full consent.
